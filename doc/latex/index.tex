 Morpion is a solitaire game. Rules and goals are explained in \href{doc/instructions.pdf}{\tt \textquotesingle{}instruction.\+pdf\textquotesingle{}}.

\subsection*{Getting Started}

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

\subsubsection*{Prerequisites}

The project runs preferably on a linux machine. The only required tools are G\+CC, the G\+NU Compiler Collection, and make, the G\+NU make utility. They should be installed by default. If they are not, the following linux command will install gcc


\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo apt install gcc
\end{DoxyCode}


And this command will install make


\begin{DoxyCode}
sudo apt install build-essential
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Building}

To build the project, simple type the following command on the root of the project


\begin{DoxyCode}
make
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Running the game}

Go to the sources directory and execute the program


\begin{DoxyCode}
./run
\end{DoxyCode}


Note that the executable is not produced during the build yet. The game cannot be run in {\itshape lot a} version.
