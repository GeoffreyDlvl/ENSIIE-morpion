# Morpion

*Imperative programming project.*<br /><br />   
Morpion is a solitaire game. Rules and goals are explained in ['instruction.pdf'](doc/instructions.pdf).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

The project runs preferably on a linux machine. The only required tools are GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection, and make, the GNU make utility. They should be installed by default. If they are not, the following linux command will install gcc

```
sudo apt install gcc
```

And this command will install make

```
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### Building

To build the project, simple type the following command on the root of the project

```
make
```

## Running the game

Go to the sources directory and execute the program

```
./run
```

Note that the executable is not produced during the build yet. The game cannot be run in *lot a* version.

## Built With

* [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org) - The GNU Compiler Collection

## Versioning
